here have been so many new image and video innovations released over the last few weeks that it’s hard to know where to start. So we’ll start with the Video Chapter Editor, which seamlessly creates and edits captivating video chapters. Next, elevate your video content further with the groundbreaking Paced Subtitles, providing meticulous control over pacing. Then there’s the cutting-edge Enhanced 3D Viewer, featuring improved lighting, shadows, and AR support for an unparalleled product visualization experience. Last is the new Dynamic Shadow support for 3D to 2D rendering.&nbsp;

Let’s take a closer look at these updates.

## **Elevate Accessibility and SEO Impact With Our Video Chapters Editor**



Available from within the [video player console](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/rn_pm_09_21_2023#video_player_studio_in_the_console), the Video Chapters Editor is ideal for enhancing engagement in long-form content like product explainers, how-to guides, tutorials, and webinars.

The Video Chapters Editor tool will enhance accessibility and user experience, facilitate easy navigation on mobile devices, and contribute significantly to search engine optimization (SEO). By strategically organizing your content into chapters, you enhance its discoverability and relevance.&nbsp;

Define, edit, or upload your chapters using the Chapters Editor in the [Video Player Studio](https://console.cloudinary.com/pm/video-player-studio). From the Chapters section of the studio, you have the following options:

* **Upload a VTT file**. Use this to upload your chapters VTT file and have it applied to your selected video.
* **Update chapters manually**. Define your chapter names and timestamps manually for the selected video. By default, the chapter will be added using the current time of the seekbar in the preview window. The chapters will be added to a new VTT file uploaded alongside your video, and you can see how this is referenced in the code window.

Take charge of your video content, boost discoverability, and redefine the way your audience engages with your videos.

## **The Power of Paced Subtitles: Transforming Viewer Engagement**



Subtitles are a crucial component of the viewing experience. Paced Subtitles redefine this experience by providing content creators with control over subtitle pacing by allowing you to adjust the number of words displayed in each subtitle, ensuring that your content isn’t only accessible but also engaging for many use cases.&nbsp;

You can tailor the pacing of subtitles to match the preferences and needs of your diverse audience. Whether your viewers prefer a leisurely reading pace or a brisk flow, the configurability of Paced Subtitles allows for optimal readability and comprehension, eliminating the risk of overwhelming viewers. For example, in educational tutorials, paced subtitles offer individuals ample time to read and comprehend intricate material. In mobile, where screen real estate is limited, creators can strategically deploy paced subtitles to display concise information, optimizing readability for individuals on smaller devices.&nbsp;

Paced subtitles are added by generating a Cloudinary transcript file and adding the maxWords parameter to your track configuration. Use the [Google AI Video Transcription add-on](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/google_ai_video_transcription_addon) to create the appropriate Cloudinary transcript file for your video.

**Note:** Translations are not supported for paced subtitles.

## **3D Viewer With Enhanced Lighting, Shadows, and AR Support**



Cloudinary has significantly upgraded its 3D Viewer in the Product Gallery Widget. Updates include improved lighting, shadows, and augmented reality (AR) support to redefine the way customers experience and interact with your products.

The upgraded 3D Viewer significantly improves the appearance of your 3D models.&nbsp;

We’ve also integrated AR support into the 3D Viewer. On mobile devices, customers can now immerse themselves in the AR experience with a single tap to open the AR viewer directly, allowing the user to visualize products in their real-world environment.

For desktop users, the AR experience is accessible via a QR code that enables the viewer to see the product in AR mode on their mobile devices, ensuring a consistent and immersive experience across various platforms.

As we unveil the enhanced 3D Viewer with improved lighting, shadows, and AR support, we invite you to reimagine the way you showcase your products online.&nbsp;

## **3D to 2D Photorealism With Dynamic Shadow Support**



Cloudinary introduces a groundbreaking enhancement that takes 3D to 2D rendered images to a whole new level — the integration of dynamic shadows.&nbsp;

The new Light Effect [e\_light](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/transformation_reference#e_light) feature enhances the overall photorealism of your images by creating shadows. Whether you’re showcasing products, architectural designs, or virtual environments, the e\_light effect brings an unparalleled level of control and realism to your visual content.

The shadow intensity parameter, [e\_shadow](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/transformation_reference#e_shadow), empowers you to customize the shadows, ensuring that they perfectly complement your artistic vision. From subtle shadows that add a touch of realism to bold, dramatic shadows that make a statement, control is in your hands.

Whether you’re a designer, marketer, or content creator, this enhancement opens up new possibilities for creating visually stunning and immersive content.&nbsp;
